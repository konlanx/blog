# Finding the Right Backend for My App: Why I Chose Supabase

One of the key challenges in building an app is deciding on the right backend technology. There are so many options, from rolling out a custom backend with something like NestJS or Django to using a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) solution. Since I wanted to get started quickly and focus more on the frontend and user experience, I started evaluating different BaaS platforms.

## Evaluating the Options: Supabase, Appwrite, and Firebase

I narrowed my choices down to three major players:

- **Firebase**: Google's well-known BaaS solution, offering Firestore, authentication, and serverless functions. While Firebase is well-integrated into the Google ecosystem, I wasn't a big fan of its NoSQL database and some of its pricing models.
- **Appwrite**: An open-source alternative that looked promising but seemed to require a bit more setup, especially since I’d need to self-host or rely on their managed cloud (which is still growing).
- **Supabase**: Marketed as the "open-source alternative to Firebase," it uses PostgreSQL as its database, which I see as a huge advantage.

## Choosing Supabase: Fast and Simple Authentication

What ultimately pushed me towards **Supabase** was its authentication system. Authentication can be a real headache, but with Supabase, I was able to implement **email authentication and social login (Google and Apple) in just a few hours**. Their **Flutter package** provided a quick way to set up a UI for authentication, which saved me even more time.

## BaaS: The Perfect Fit for Early Stages

At this stage, my app is still in its **early development phase**, meaning a lot of what I need is simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Supabase provides exactly that with an easy-to-use PostgreSQL database, so I don’t have to spend time building a backend from scratch.

A huge advantage of using **Supabase** is that it offers a **generous free tier**, which is **perfect for the early stages** of development when costs need to be kept low. Later, when the app scales and requires more resources, **Supabase can be self-hosted**, which means I have the flexibility to reduce long-term costs or move everything to my own infrastructure if needed.

## Next Steps: Exploring Edge Functions

Another reason I’m happy with Supabase is its **Edge Functions**, which allow me to write custom server-side logic in **TypeScript and Deno**. Since I have **years of TypeScript experience**, this makes it easy to extend my app beyond simple database queries when needed.

## Conclusion

By choosing **Supabase**, I’ve managed to get my app up and running with **authentication and a backend in just a short time**. BaaS solutions aren’t always the right fit for every project, but in my case—where I need fast iteration and a solid foundation—it has been a great choice. The fact that it’s **free to start and can be self-hosted later** makes it a future-proof option for my project.
