# Finding the Idea for Aventuvo – From Blank Page to a Clearer Vision

Starting a new project always comes with an initial challenge: **What should I actually build?** When I decided that I wanted to create a mobile app, I assumed the hardest part would be the technical implementation. But I quickly realized that **finding a good idea was much harder than expected**.

## Drowning in Useless Advice

The internet is full of advice for aspiring founders. Communities on **Reddit, Instagram, and LinkedIn** are packed with posts labeled as "startup advice," but most of them are just **founders promoting their own products** rather than providing genuinely useful insights. The common advice—“Solve a problem you care about”—sounds great in theory, but when you’re actually searching for an idea, it feels like **there are no obvious problems left that need solving**.

## The Illusion of an Untouched Niche

At first, I thought I had to find **a completely unique, never-before-seen idea**. But the deeper I looked, the more I realized how difficult that is. If an idea truly doesn’t exist yet, there’s usually a reason: either **nobody needs it**, or it’s simply **too difficult to execute** in a practical way.

After going through dozens of ideas and finding flaws in almost all of them, I started shifting my mindset: instead of trying to be the first person to invent something, I started looking at **existing problems that could be solved better**.

## The First Failed Idea: Subscription-Based Free Time Activities

One of my early ideas was an app that would let people subscribe to **different free-time activities** in their area—a kind of **“Netflix for hobbies.”** The idea was that, instead of committing to a full membership at a gym, dance school, or art class, people could **pay a monthly fee and freely switch between activities**.

It sounded interesting, but as I thought it through, it became clear that it wasn’t practical:

1. **Pricing would be a nightmare** – Every service has different costs, and there’s no standard way to combine them into a single subscription model.
2. **Too much bureaucracy** – Handling payments, contracts, and agreements with multiple businesses would require a lot of administrative work.
3. **High fluctuation** – Many businesses frequently change their pricing, availability, or even shut down entirely. Keeping the app’s data accurate would be a constant challenge.

It became clear pretty quickly that this idea was not worth pursuing.

## The Next Attempt: A Map for Free-Time Activities

Rather than dealing with complex subscriptions, I shifted to something much simpler: **a map that shows free-time activities nearby**. No payments, no bureaucracy—just a way for people to **discover interesting things to do** in their area.

This seemed more feasible, but it still felt **too broad**. There are already many generic location-based apps, and I wasn’t sure how to make mine stand out. That’s when I started thinking about **who exactly this app should be for**.

## A More Defined Concept: Helping Parents Find Activities for Their Children

Eventually, I landed on a more specific version of the idea: an app specifically designed for **parents who want to find fun and interesting activities for their children in their local area**. Instead of just listing general places, the app would focus on:

- **Age-appropriate activities**
- **Safety and family-friendliness**
- **Reviews from other parents**
- **Hidden gems that might not be well-marketed**

At this stage, I felt like I had **a strong foundation to work with**. The idea seemed useful, the audience was clearly defined, and it was something that **I hadn’t seen done well yet**.

## The Market Check: Finding Competitors and What That Really Means

Once I had this idea, I did something that every founder dreads: **I checked the market** to see if similar apps already existed.

And, of course, they did. I found **two other apps** with a similar concept.

At first, this was discouraging. Finding competitors can feel like discovering that someone else has already built your dream project. It made me wonder: **Is there even room for another app like this?**

But after thinking about it more, I started seeing the **value in competition**. Here’s why:

### 1. Competition Means There’s Demand

If multiple companies are already working on similar ideas, that means **people actually want this service**. The worst-case scenario for a founder isn’t competition—it’s discovering that **nobody cares about your idea at all**. If there are other apps in this space, that means **there’s a market for it**.

### 2. The Existing Solutions Aren’t Perfect

When I looked deeper into these competing apps, I noticed they weren’t doing everything right. There were clear areas where I could **improve the user experience**, **offer better data**, or **focus more on community-driven content**. Just because a concept already exists doesn’t mean it has been executed in the best way possible.

### 3. Many Markets Have Room for Multiple Players

Very few markets are won by a single company. **Think about restaurants, streaming services, or even social media**—there isn’t just one dominant option, but many alternatives with their own strengths. An existing market doesn’t mean there’s no space left. It just means I need to **differentiate my app enough to make it a compelling choice**.

### 4. Learning from Their Mistakes

Seeing how other apps approached the problem gave me **insights into what works and what doesn’t**. Instead of starting from scratch, I could analyze their mistakes and successes to refine my own approach.

After processing all of this, I actually felt **more confident** about pursuing the idea. The fact that similar apps existed wasn’t a **dead end**—it was proof that the idea had potential.

## What’s Next?

With a clearer concept in mind, I’m now moving forward with the next steps:

✅ Refining the app’s core features  
✅ Planning the technical implementation  
✅ Thinking about how to position it in the market

There are still a lot of open questions, and I don’t expect everything to go smoothly. But after struggling to find an idea in the first place, it’s great to finally have **a direction to explore**.
