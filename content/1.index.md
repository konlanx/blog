Hi, I'm Tim!

#description
I am a developer who loves to learn new things and share them with others. My focus is on web development and mobile app development.

In this blog you can find articles about web development, mobile app development, and other things I find interesting.

You will also see content about topics that are important to me personally, such as mental health and personal development, especially focused on ADHD and autism.
